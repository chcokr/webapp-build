This repository used to host a horrible attempt of mine to force consistency among my webapp projects. I have found better alternatives (e.g. https://github.com/chcokr/chcokr-webapp-starter) and no longer use the repository for this purpose. Instead I use its [issues](https://github.com/chcokr/webapp-build/issues) section as a backlog of my ideas pertaining to write webapps.
